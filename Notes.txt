url_for() takes one or more arguements: a function to route to, and a list of key=value pairs.
    The first is the name of a specific function.
    The remaining parameters are keyword arguments that correspond to variable parts of the URL being built.
    Example: url_for('static', filename='css/app.css') builds the url/path to a static resource (a built-in, already known location) and adds the path to a specific filename.

Extend a Template into an HTML file with Jinja2 by adding this at the top:
    {% extents "baseTemplate.html" $}

In Jinja2, single curly braces indicate that the code should be resolved, double means "make a call".  There's gotta be a better way to express this idea...
    {% for j in jobs %}
      <div class="iamaclass">
        {{ show_job(j) }}
      </div>
    {% endfor %}

Always a good reminder: don't assume the system works just because the tests pass--use it!  Automated tests are great, but are not a full replacement for manual and/or experimental testing.  :)
