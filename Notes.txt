url_for() takes one or more arguements: a function to route to, and a list of key=value pairs.
    The first is the name of a specific function.
    The remaining parameters are keyword arguments that correspond to variable parts of the URL being built.
    Example: url_for('static', filename='css/app.css') builds the url/path to a static resource (a built-in, already known location) and adds the path to a specific filename.
